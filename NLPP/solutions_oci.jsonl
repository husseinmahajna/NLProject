The normal way would be to compute 2^n and then take modulus with p but this could lead to overflow for large n as 2^n can become very big number. Instead, we use property of modular arithmetic i.e., (a*b)%p = ((a%p)*(b%p))%p.

If n is even, it calculates half of the power for n/2 (recursive call) and squares the result as per property mentioned above. If n is odd, it reduces the problem to even by subtracting 1 and multiplies with 2 before applying the recursion.

The `range(len(s)-2)` generates indices for the first character of every three-character substring in the string. Then, `s[i:i+3]` extracts that three-character substring. Finally, `set(s[i:i+3])` creates a set from those three characters (which automatically removes duplicates). If the length of this set is not 3, it means that there were duplicate letters in the three-character substring and the string is not \"happy\". Otherwise, if the entire string has been processed without finding any non-\"happy\" substrings, then the function returns `True`."]}

For each integer i, we first check if it is a palindrome - that is, it reads the same backward as forward. We do this by converting the number to string and comparing it with its reverse (obtained via [::-1]). Then we check whether the number is even or odd: an even number is divisible by 2 without leaving any remainder, while an odd number leaves a remainder when divided by 2.\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n*m) where n is the input number and m is the average length of numbers from 1 to n. This is because for each number i in range(1, n+1), we perform string comparison and modulo operation which are constant time operations. The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few variables for counting even and odd palindromes and the input size does not affect the space usage."]}

A path can be formed by moving from one cell to any of its neighboring cells (up, down, left or right). \n\nThis problem could be solved using dynamic programming and depth-first search(DFS) approach. The idea is to start DFS from each cell in the grid and keep track of minimum paths for all possible lengths upto 'k'. We will use a memoization technique to avoid recomputation of same subproblems.\n\nHere's how you could implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef minPath(grid, k):\n    n = len(grid)\n    \n    # Initialize the dp array with infinity for all states except the starting state\n    dp = [[[float('inf')] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    dp[0][0] = [grid[0][0]] * (k + 1)\n    \n    # Define directions for moving to neighboring cells\n    dirs = [[0, 1], [0, -1], [1, 0], [-1, 0]]\n\n    # DFS + memoization function\n    def dfs(x, y, z):\n        if dp[x][y][z] != float('inf'):\n            return dp[x][y][z]\n        \n        dp[x][y][z] = [grid[x][y]] + min([dfs(x + dx, y + dy, z - 1) for dx, dy in dirs if 0 <= x + dx < n and 0 <= y + dy < n], default=[])\n        \n        return dp[x][y][z]\n    \n    # Call the DFS function starting from each cell\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            dfs(i, j, k)\n            \n    return min([dp[i][j][k] for i in range(n) for j in range(n)], key=lambda x: (len(x), x))\n```\nThis function returns the minimum path of length 'k' as a list of cell values. If there are multiple paths with same number of cells, it chooses lexicographically smallest one. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that grid is non-negative and all inputs are valid (i.<\uff5cbegin\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>"]}

This function works by iterating over a list of tuples, each containing a roman numeral and its corresponding integer value.

{"task_id": "HumanEval/158", "solution": ["\nHere is a Python solution for the problem. The function `find_max` goes through each word in the list and counts unique characters using the set data structure which only stores unique elements. It then sorts words based on the number of unique characters in descending order and lexicographical order if there are ties. \n\n```python\ndef find_max(words):\n    max_unique = -1\n    for word in words:\n        num_unique = len(set(word))\n        if num_unique > max_unique:\n            max_unique = num_unique\n            max_word = word\n        elif num_unique == max_unique and word < max_word:\n            max_word = word\n    return max_word\n```\nThis function will work as expected. For example, for the input `[\"name\", \"of\", \"string\"]` it returns `\"string\"` because 's' in string has 6 unique characters which is more than any other word and comes before 'n' and 'o' in name. Similarly for [\"name\", \"enam\", \"game\"], it returns \"enam\" as it has maximum number of unique characters i.e. 3 and it comes first in lexicographical order."]}
{"task_id": "HumanEval/159", "solution": ["\nHere is a Python solution for the problem. The function checks if there are enough carrots left to meet the need, and if so it eats as many as needed, otherwise it eats all remaining carrots. It then returns the total number of eaten carrots and the leftover carrots.\n\n```python\ndef eat(number, need, remaining):\n    # Calculate how many more carrots are needed\n    need_more = need - number\n    \n    # If there are enough left, eat as much as needed\n    if need_more <= remaining:\n        eaten = need_more\n        leftover = remaining - need_more\n    # Otherwise, eat all remaining carrots\n    else:\n        eaten = remaining\n        leftover = 0\n    \n    total_eaten = number + eaten\n    \n    return [total_eaten, leftover]\n```\nThis function works by first calculating how many more carrots are needed to meet the daily need. If there are enough left to eat this much, it eats that amount and calculates the remaining carrots. Otherwise, it eats all remaining carrots and sets the leftover count to 0. The total number of eaten carrots is then the sum of the already eaten carrots and the just-eaten carrots."]}

For each number, it converts the number to a string and then iterates over its digits. If a digit is even (i.e., remainder of division by 2 equals 0), it appends this digit to the result list.\n\nFinally, it sorts the resulting list in ascending order before returning it.
