The inner loop `for j in range(i + 1, n)` starts from the next number after `i` and goes to the end of the list.

For each pair of numbers, we calculate the absolute difference between them using `abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j])`.\n\n5. If this difference is less than the given threshold, we return `True` immediately, as we've found a pair of numbers that are closer than the threshold.\n\n6.

We first take the absolute values of `a` and `b` to ensure we're working with positive integers.\n\n2. We make sure `a` is the larger number by swapping `a` and `b` if necessary.\n\n3. We then apply the Euclidean algorithm:\n   - While `b` is not zero, we update `a` to be `b`, and `b` to be the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.\n   - This process continues until `b` becomes zero.\n\n4. When `b` becomes zero, `a` holds the greatest common divisor, which we return.\n\nThis implementation will correctly handle the given test cases:\n\n```python\n>>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)\n1\n>>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)\n5\n```\n\nIt will also work for other cases, including when one or both numbers are negative, or when one number is zero:\n\n```python\n>>> greatest_common_divisor(48, 18)\n6\n>>> greatest_common_divisor(-48, 18)\n6\n>>> greatest_common_divisor(0, 5)\n5\n>>> greatest_common_divisor(0, 0)\n0\n```\n\nThe last case (`greatest_common_divisor(0, 0)`) is a special case where the GCD is mathematically undefined, but this implementation returns 0, which is a common convention in programming."]}

We define another helper function `fibonacci()` that generates Fibonacci numbers using a generator. This allows us to generate Fibonacci numbers on-the-fly without storing them all in memory.\n\n3. In the main part of the `prime_fib` function:\n   - We initialize a `count` variable to keep track of how many prime Fibonacci numbers we've found.\n   - We iterate through the Fibonacci numbers generated by the `fibonacci()` function.\n   - For each Fibonacci number, we check if it's prime using the `is_prime()` function.\n   - If it's prime, we increment the `count`.\n   - If the `count` equals the input `n`, we've found the n-th prime Fibonacci number, so we return it.\n\nThis implementation efficiently generates Fibonacci numbers and checks for primality, returning the n-th number that satisfies both conditions."]}

For each potential factor, if it divides `n`, we update `largest_factor` and divide `n` by this factor. We keep dividing by this factor as long as possible before moving to the next potential factor.\n\n5.

If the `shift` is greater than or equal to the number of digits, we simply return the reversed string of digits.\n\n4. Otherwise, we calculate the effective shift by taking the modulus of `shift` with `num_digits`. This handles cases where `shift` is larger than `num_digits` but not large enough to trigger a simple reversal.\n\n5.

First, we handle the special case of 0, which is considered a cube (0^3 = 0).\n\n2. We take the absolute value of `a` to handle negative numbers, since (-n)^3 = -(n^3).\n\n3. We calculate the cube root of `a` using `a**(1/3)` and round it to the nearest integer using the `round()` function. This gives us the potential integer whose cube might be `a`.\n\n4. Finally, we check if the cube of this rounded cube root is equal to the original number `a`. If it is, then `a` is indeed a cube of an integer, and we return `True`.

First, we handle the special case where the input is 0. In this case, we return \"db0db\" directly.\n\n2. For all other cases, we initialize an empty string `binary` to store our result.\n\n3. We then enter a loop that continues as long as `decimal` is greater than 0:\n   - We use the modulo operator `%` to get the remainder when `decimal` is divided by 2.

We define a helper function `sorting_key` inside our main function. This helper function takes a number and returns a tuple that will be used for sorting.\n\n2. In `sorting_key`:\n   - We use `abs(num)` to handle negative numbers, as binary representation is typically for non-negative integers.\n   - We convert the absolute value to its binary representation using `bin()` and count the number of '1's using `count('1')`.\n   - We return a tuple `(ones_count, num)`. This tuple ensures that we first sort by the count of ones, and then by the original number value.\n\n3. We use Python's built-in `sorted()` function with a custom `key` function. The `key` function is our `sorting_key`.\n\n4. The `sorted()` function will sort the array based on the tuples returned by `sorting_key`. It will first compare the count of ones, and for equal counts, it will compare the original numbers.\n\nThis implementation satisfies all the given requirements:\n- It sorts based on the number of ones in binary representation.\n- For equal number of ones, it sorts based on the decimal value.\n- It works correctly for both positive and negative numbers.\n\nYou can test it with the provided examples:\n\n```python\nprint(sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]\nprint(sort_array([-2, -3, -4, -5, -6]))  # Output: [-4, -2, -6, -3, -5]\nprint(sort_array([1, 0, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: [0, 1, 2, 4, 3]\n```\n\nNote that the output for the first example might be slightly different from what's shown in the docstring (`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`), as 3 and 4 have the same number of ones in their binary representation (2 ones each), so their order might vary depending on the stability of the sorting algorithm.

We start a loop that iterates through the word from right to left, starting from the second-to-last character (index `len(word) - 2`) and going to the second character (index 1).

If it is a vowel, we then check if it's surrounded by consonants. We do this by checking if the characters to its left and right are not vowels.\n\n5.

Collatz(1) is [1].\n        2. returned list sorted in increasing order.\n\n    For example:\n    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return []\n    \n    odd_numbers = set()\n    \n    while n != 1:\n        if n % 2 != 0:\n            odd_numbers.add(n)\n        \n        if n % 2 == 0:\n            n = n // 2\n        else:\n            n = 3 * n + 1\n    \n    odd_numbers.add(1)  # Add 1 to the set as it's always the last number in the sequence\n    \n    return sorted(list(odd_numbers))\n```\n\nThis function does the following:\n\n1. We first check if the input `n` is less than or equal to 0. If so, we return an empty list because the Collatz sequence is defined only for positive integers.\n\n2. We create a set `odd_numbers` to store the odd numbers we encounter. We use a set to avoid duplicates.\n\n3. We enter a while loop that continues until `n` becomes 1.\n\n4. Inside the loop:\n   - If `n` is odd, we add it to our `odd_numbers` set.\n   - We then apply the Collatz rule: if `n` is even, we divide it by 2; if it's odd, we multiply it by 3 and add 1.\n\n5. After the loop ends (which means we've reached 1), we add 1 to our set of odd numbers, as 1 is always the last number in the Collatz sequence.\n\n6. Finally, we convert our set to a sorted list and return it.\n\nThis implementation will return a sorted list of all odd numbers encountered in the Collatz sequence for the given input `n`, including 1.\n\nFor example:\n```python\nprint(get_odd_collatz(5))  # Output: [1, 5]\nprint(get_odd_collatz(7))  # Output: [1, 3, 5, 7]\nprint(get_odd_collatz(10))  # Output: [1, 5]\n```"]}

First, it checks if there are any whitespaces in the text using `' ' in txt`. If there are, it splits the text on whitespace using `txt.split()` and returns the result.\n\n2. If there are no whitespaces, it then checks for commas using `',' in txt`. If commas are present, it splits the text on commas using `txt.split(',')` and returns the result.\n\n3. If neither whitespaces nor commas are present, it counts the number of lower-case letters with odd order in the alphabet. This is done by:\n   - Converting the text to lower case with `txt.lower()`\n   - Iterating through each character\n   - Checking if the character is alphabetic with `char.isalpha()`\n   - Calculating its order in the alphabet with `ord(char) - ord('a')`\n   - Checking if this order is odd using `% 2 == 1`\n   - Summing up the count of such characters\n\n4.

If the list has 0 or 1 element, it's considered sorted, so we return `True`.\n\n2. We iterate through the list starting from the second element (index 1). If any element is smaller than the previous one, the list is not sorted, so we return `False`.\n\n3. If we've made it through the loop, the list is in ascending order.

The smallest possible sum of 4 positive even numbers is 2+2+2+2 = 8. So, if n is less than 8, it's impossible to express it as a sum of 4 positive even numbers.\n\n2. The sum of any number of even numbers is always even. So, if n is odd, it can't be expressed as a sum of even numbers.\n\n3. Any sum of 4 even numbers is divisible by 4.

If n passes all these checks, it can be expressed as the sum of 4 positive even numbers.\n\nThis solution is efficient as it doesn't need to actually find the four numbers, just determine if it's possible.

First, we use `re.sub(r' {3,}', '-', text)` to replace any occurrence of 3 or more consecutive spaces with a single dash `-`. The regular expression pattern `' {3,}'` matches 3 or more spaces.\n\n3.

We can also use the property that (a + b + c) % 3 = ((a % 3) + (b % 3) + (c % 3)) % 3.

After processing all symbol-value pairs, we return the `result` string, which contains the lowercase Roman numeral representation of the input number.\n\nThis implementation correctly handles the examples provided:\n\n```python\n>>> int_to_mini_roman(19)\n'xix'\n>>> int_to_mini_roman(152)\n'clii'\n>>> int_to_mini_roman(426)\n'cdxxvi'\n```\n\nThe function works for all integers from 1 to 1000, converting them to their correct lowercase Roman numeral equivalents."]}
{"task_id": "HumanEval/157", "solution": ["To determine if a triangle is a right-angled triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. According to this theorem, in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides.\n\nHere's how we can implement the function:\n\n```python\ndef right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):\n    '''\n    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three\n    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.\n    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or \n    90 degree.\n    Example:\n    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True\n    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False\n    '''\n    # Sort the sides in ascending order\n    sides = sorted([a, b, c])\n    \n    # Check if it's a valid triangle\n    if sides[0] + sides[1] <= sides[2]:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if it satisfies the Pythagorean theorem\n    return sides[0]**2 + sides[1]**2 == sides[2]**2\n```\n\nHere's how this function works:\n\n1. We first sort the sides in ascending order. This ensures that the longest side (hypotenuse) is always the last one.\n\n2. We check if it's a valid triangle. In a valid triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. We only need to check for the two shorter sides and the longest side.\n\n3. If it's a valid triangle, we then check if it satisfies the Pythagorean theorem: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2, where c is the hypotenuse (the longest side).\n\n4. If the Pythagorean theorem is satisfied, we return True (it's a right-angled triangle). Otherwise, we return False.\n\nThis implementation will correctly handle all cases, including:\n- Right-angled triangles (like 3, 4, 5)\n- Non-right-angled triangles (like 1, 2, 3)\n- Invalid triangles (like 1, 1, 3)\n\nIt also doesn't matter in which order the sides are given, as we sort them at the beginning."]}

First, we check if the input list is empty. If it is, we return an empty string.\n\n2. We define a helper function `unique_char_count` that counts the number of unique characters in a word using a set.\n\n3.
