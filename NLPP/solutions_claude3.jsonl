We use two nested loops to compare each pair of numbers in the list.\n2. The outer loop iterates over the indices of the list using `range(len(numbers))`.\n3. The inner loop iterates over the remaining indices from `i + 1` to `len(numbers)`, ensuring that we don't compare the same pair of numbers twice.\n4. For each pair of numbers `numbers[i]` and `numbers[j]`, we calculate their absolute difference using `abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j])`.\n5. If the absolute difference is less than the `threshold`, we return `True` because we've found a pair of close elements.\n6. If the inner loop completes without finding any close pairs, we move to the next iteration of the outer loop.\n7. If both loops complete without finding any close pairs, we return `False`.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list, because we use nested loops to compare every pair of elements. This is not an optimal solution for large lists, but it should work well for smaller lists.\n\nYou can test the function using the provided doctest examples by running the code in an environment that supports doctests (e.g., Python REPL or a Python file with a `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block)."]}

We initialize an empty list `result` to store the separated groups, an empty list `current_group` to store the characters of the current group, and a `count` variable to keep track of the nesting level.\n2. We iterate through each character `char` in the input string `paren_string`.\n3. If `char` is not a space, we process it further:\n   - If `char` is an opening parenthesis `(`, we increment the `count` to indicate we're entering a new nested group.\n   - If `char` is a closing parenthesis `)`, we decrement the `count` to indicate we're closing a nested group.\n4. We append the current character `char` to the `current_group` list.\n5. If `count` becomes zero, it means we have completed a balanced group. We join the characters in `current_group` into a string using `''.join(current_group)`, append it to the `result` list, and reset `current_group` to an empty list.\n6. After iterating through all characters, we return the `result` list containing the separated groups.\n\nHere are some test cases:\n\n```python\nprint(separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))'))  # Output: ['()', '(())', '(()())']\nprint(separate_paren_groups('(()())'))  # Output: ['(()())']\nprint(separate_paren_groups('()(())(((()))'))  # Output: ['()', '(())', '(((()))']\nprint(separate_paren_groups('()()()'))  # Output: ['()', '()', '()']\n```\n\nThis implementation assumes that the input string contains only parentheses and spaces.

{"task_id": "HumanEval/10", "solution": ["The `make_palindrome` function in the given code is designed to find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string. Here's a breakdown of how the function works:\n\n1. The function takes a string `string` as input.\n2. The first step is to find the longest postfix (suffix) of the supplied string that is a palindrome. This can be done by iterating over the string from the end and checking if the substring from the end to the current index forms a palindrome.\n3. Once the longest palindromic postfix is found, we need to append the reverse of the prefix (the part of the string before the palindromic postfix) to the end of the string. This will ensure that the resulting string is a palindrome.\n\nHere's an example implementation of the `make_palindrome` function:\n\n```python\ndef make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string. \"\"\"\n    n = len(string)\n    \n    # Find the longest palindromic suffix\n    for i in range(n, -1, -1):\n        suffix = string[i:]\n        if suffix == suffix[::-1]:\n            prefix = string[:i]\n            break\n    \n    # Append reverse of prefix to the end of the string\n    return string + prefix[::-1]\n```\n\nLet's go through the code:\n\n1. The length of the input string `string` is stored in the variable `n`.\n2. We iterate over the string from the end using the `range(n, -1, -1)` loop. This loop starts from `n` (the length of the string) and goes down to 0 (inclusive) with a step of -1.\n3. Inside the loop, we extract the suffix of the string from the current index `i` using `string[i:]`. This gives us the substring from index `i` to the end of the string.\n4. We check if the extracted suffix is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse using `suffix == suffix[::-1]`.\n5. If the suffix is a palindrome, we break out of the loop and store the prefix (the part of the string before the palindromic suffix) in the variable `prefix` using `string[:i]`.\n6. After the loop, we construct the desired palindrome by concatenating the original string `string` with the reverse of the prefix `prefix[::-1]`.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n```python\n>>> make_palindrome('')\n''\n>>> make_palindrome('cat')\n'catac'\n>>> make_palindrome('cata')\n'catac'\n>>> make_palindrome('abba')\n'abba'\n>>> make_palindrome('abcd')\n'abcdcba'\n```\n\nIn the last example, `'abcd'` has no palindromic suffix, so the entire prefix `'abcd'` is reversed and appended to the end to form the shortest palindrome `'abcdcba'`."]}

If `n` is not divisible by `divisor`, we increment `divisor` by 1 to try the next potential divisor.\n6. After the loop terminates, we check if `n` is greater than 1. If it is, we append `n` to the `factors` list, as it represents the last remaining prime factor.\n7. Finally, we return the `factors` list containing all the prime factors of the original number `n`.\n\nHere's how the function behaves for the examples you provided:\n\n```python\n>>> factorize(8)\n[2, 2, 2]\n>>> factorize(25)\n[5, 5]\n>>> factorize(70)\n[2, 5, 7]\n```\n\nThe time complexity of this implementation is O(sqrt(n)), as we only need to check divisors up to the square root of `n`. However, it's worth noting that this implementation assumes that `n` is a positive integer."]}

First, we split the input string `s` into groups of three characters using a list comprehension similar to the one used in `encode_cyclic`:\n\n```python\ngroups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]\n```\n\n2. Next, we cycle the elements in each group in the reverse order compared to the `encode_cyclic` function. We do this by moving the last character to the front of the group:\n\n```python\ngroups = [group[-1] + group[:-1] if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]\n```\n\nThis list comprehension iterates over each group in the `groups` list. If the group has exactly three characters, it moves the last character to the front of the group by concatenating `group[-1]` (the last character) and `group[:-1]` (all characters except the last one). If the group has fewer than three characters, it remains unchanged.\n\n3. Finally, we join all the groups back into a single string using the `join` method:\n\n```python\nreturn \"\".join(groups)\n```\n\nThis line concatenates all the strings in the `groups` list into a single string, which represents the decoded version of the input string.\n\nWith these two functions, `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`, you can encode and decode strings by cycling groups of three characters."]}

The `fib` function generates the n-th Fibonacci number using recursion.

The `prime_fib` function is the main function that finds the n-th prime Fibonacci number.\n    - It initializes a `count` variable to keep track of the number of prime Fibonacci numbers found so far.\n    - It initializes an `i` variable to generate Fibonacci numbers sequentially.\n    - It enters a loop that continues until the `count` is equal to `n`.\n    - Inside the loop, it generates the current Fibonacci number using the `fib` function and checks if it's prime using the `is_prime` function.\n    - If the current Fibonacci number is prime, it increments the `count`.\n    - If the `count` becomes equal to `n`, it means we've found the n-th prime Fibonacci number, so it returns the current Fibonacci number.\n    - If the `count` is still less than `n`, it increments `i` to generate the next Fibonacci number.\n\n4. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block runs the doctests for the `prime_fib` function, ensuring that it works as expected for the given examples.\n\nNote that this implementation is not very efficient for large values of `n` because it generates all Fibonacci numbers up to the n-th prime Fibonacci number, which can be computationally expensive for large `n`.

The function first checks if `n` is 0. If `n` is 0, then 2^0 = 1, so the function returns 1.\n2. If `n` is not 0, the function uses the built-in `pow` function to calculate `2^n` modulo `p`. The `pow` function takes three arguments: the base (2 in this case), the exponent (`n`), and the modulus (`p`). This calculation is done efficiently using modular arithmetic.\n3. The result of `pow(2, n, p)` is returned as the final result.\n\nThe docstring provides some examples of how the function should behave:\n\n- `modp(3, 5)` returns 3, because 2^3 = 8, and 8 modulo 5 is 3.\n- `modp(1101, 101)` returns 2, because 2^1101 modulo 101 is 2.\n- `modp(0, 101)` returns 1, because 2^0 is always 1.\n- `modp(3, 11)` returns 8, because 2^3 = 8, and 8 modulo 11 is 8.\n- `modp(100, 101)` returns 1, because 2^100 modulo 101 is 1.\n\nNote that the function uses type hints (`n: int` and `p: int`) to indicate that the input arguments should be integers.

The function takes a string `s` as input, which is assumed to be encoded using the `encode_shift` function.\n2. The list comprehension iterates over each character `ch` in the input string `s`.\n3. For each character `ch`, it calculates the ASCII value of the decoded character by:\n   - Subtracting 5 from the ASCII value of `ch` to shift it backward by 5 positions in the alphabet.\n   - Subtracting the ASCII value of `\"a\"` to get the index of the character relative to `\"a\"`.\n   - Taking the modulus with 26 (the number of letters in the English alphabet) to handle wrap-around cases (e.g., shifting `\"a\"` backward by 5 should give `\"z\"`).\n   - Adding the ASCII value of `\"a\"` to get the final ASCII value of the decoded character.\n4. The `chr` function is used to convert the ASCII value back to a character.\n5.

For each coefficient `xs[i]`, we calculate the coefficient of the derivative term by multiplying it with the exponent `i`.\n5.

{"task_id": "HumanEval/65", "solution": ["The `circular_shift` function takes two arguments: `x` (an integer) and `shift` (the number of positions to shift the digits of `x`). Its purpose is to shift the digits of `x` to the right by `shift` positions and return the result as a string. If `shift` is greater than the number of digits in `x`, the function should return the digits of `x` in reverse order.\n\nHere's how the function can be implemented:\n\n```python\ndef circular_shift(x, shift):\n    \"\"\"Circular shift the digits of the integer x, shift the digits right by shift\n    and return the result as a string.\n    If shift > number of digits, return digits reversed.\n    >>> circular_shift(12, 1)\n    \"21\"\n    >>> circular_shift(12, 2)\n    \"12\"\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the integer to a string\n    x_str = str(x)\n    \n    # Calculate the number of digits\n    n_digits = len(x_str)\n    \n    # Handle the case where shift is greater than the number of digits\n    if shift > n_digits:\n        return x_str[::-1]\n    \n    # Perform the circular shift\n    shifted_str = x_str[-shift:] + x_str[:-shift]\n    \n    return shifted_str\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. First, we convert the integer `x` to a string using the `str()` function: `x_str = str(x)`.\n2. We calculate the number of digits in `x` using the `len()` function: `n_digits = len(x_str)`.\n3. If `shift` is greater than `n_digits`, we return the digits of `x` in reverse order using the slice notation `x_str[::-1]`.\n4. If `shift` is not greater than `n_digits`, we perform the circular shift by slicing the string `x_str`:\n   - `x_str[-shift:]` returns the last `shift` characters of the string.\n   - `x_str[:-shift]` returns the string without the last `shift` characters.\n   - The concatenation `x_str[-shift:] + x_str[:-shift]` gives us the shifted string.\n5.

The input string `s` is split into parts using the `split()` method: `parts = s.split()`. This creates a list of substrings separated by whitespace characters. For example, if `s` is `\"5 apples and 6 oranges\"`, `parts` becomes `['5', 'apples', 'and', '6', 'oranges']`.\n\n2. The number of apples is extracted from the first element of `parts` using `apples = int(parts[0])`, which converts the string `'5'` to the integer `5`.\n\n3. The number of oranges is extracted from the fourth element of `parts` using `oranges = int(parts[2])`, which converts the string `'6'` to the integer `6`.\n\n4. The number of mangoes is calculated by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits `n`: `mangoes = n - apples - oranges`.\n\n5.

{"task_id": "HumanEval/73", "solution": ["To solve this problem, we can use a two-pointer approach and compare the elements from both ends of the array. If they are not equal, we need to change one of them to make the array palindromic. We can keep track of the minimum number of changes required and return it at the end.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve this problem:\n\n```python\ndef smallest_change(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that\n    need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that\n    is read the same backwards and forwards.

We initialize two pointers `left` and `right` pointing to the start and end of the array, respectively.\n2. We also initialize a variable `changes` to keep track of the number of elements that need to be changed.\n3. We then enter a loop that continues until `left` is less than `right`.\n4. Inside the loop, we compare the elements at `left` and `right` indices. If they are not equal, we increment the `changes` variable by 1.\n5. We then move the `left` pointer one step to the right and the `right` pointer one step to the left.\n6. After the loop terminates, we divide `changes` by 2 and return the result. This is because for every pair of mismatched elements, we only need to change one of them (we consider changing the element at the `left` index).\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n```python\nprint(smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6]))  # Output: 4\nprint(smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]))  # Output: 1\nprint(smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]))  # Output: 0\n```\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, since we traverse the array once using two pointers. The space complexity is O(1) since we only use a constant amount of extra space."]}

The function calculates the total number of characters in each list using a generator expression and the `sum()` function. The generator expression `len(string) for string in lst1` generates the lengths of each string in `lst1`, and `sum()` adds them all up to get the total number of characters in `lst1`. The same is done for `lst2`.\n\n2. After calculating the total characters in each list, the function compares them. If the total characters in `lst1` are less than the total characters in `lst2`, it returns `lst1`. Otherwise, it returns `lst2`.\n\n3. If the two lists have the same number of total characters, the function will return the first list (`lst1`).\n\nExamples:\n\n```python\nprint(total_match([], []))  # Output: []\nprint(total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'Hi']))  # Output: ['hI', 'Hi']\nprint(total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hi', 'hi', 'admin', 'project']))  # Output: ['hi', 'admin']\nprint(total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']))  # Output: ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']\nprint(total_match(['4'], ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']))  # Output: ['4']\n```\n\nNote that the function assumes that the input lists contain only strings.

So, the count of numbers starting with 1 is `9 * (10 ** (n - 2))`.\n3. To count the numbers ending with 1 but not starting with 1, we subtract the count of numbers starting with 1 from the total number of (n-1)-digit numbers (10 ** (n - 1)). This gives us `(10 ** (n - 1)) - (9 * (10 ** (n - 2)))`.\n4. The total count is the sum of the numbers starting with 1 and the numbers ending with 1 but not starting with 1.\n5. The function returns the total count.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n```python\nprint(starts_one_ends(1))  # Output: 2\nprint(starts_one_ends(2))  # Output: 18\nprint(starts_one_ends(3))  # Output: 180\nprint(starts_one_ends(4))  # Output: 1800\n```\n\nIn the above examples:\n- For `n=1`, there are only two numbers (1 and 1) that start or end with 1, so the output is 2.\n- For `n=2`, there are 9 numbers starting with 1 (10-19) and 9 numbers ending with 1 but not starting with 1 (21-29), so the output is 18.\n- For `n=3`, there are 90 numbers starting with 1 (100-199) and 90 numbers ending with 1 but not starting with 1 (201-299), so the output is 180.\n- For `n=4`, there are 900 numbers starting with 1 (1000-1999) and 900 numbers ending with 1 but not starting with 1 (2001-2999), so the output is 1800."]}

First, we convert the given integer `N` to a binary string using the built-in `bin` function. The `bin` function returns a string representation of the binary number, prefixed with `'0b'`. We slice the string from index 2 to remove the prefix `'0b'`.\n\n2. Next, we calculate the sum of digits in the binary string using a generator expression `sum(int(digit) for digit in binary_str)`. This converts each character in the binary string to an integer and sums them up.\n\n3. The calculated sum is then converted back to a binary string using the `bin` function and slicing the prefix `'0b'` from the result.\n\n4. Finally, the binary string representation of the sum is returned.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n```python\nprint(solve(1000))  # Output: \"1\"\nprint(solve(150))   # Output: \"110\"\nprint(solve(147))   # Output: \"1100\"\n```\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the input `N` is within the given constraints (0 \u2264 N \u2264 10000)."]}

We initialize a variable `total` to 0, which will store the sum of even elements at odd indices.\n2. We use a `for` loop to iterate over the list `lst`. The loop starts from index 1 (the second element) and increments by 2 (skipping every other element) using the `range(1, len(lst), 2)` expression.\n3. Inside the loop, we check if the current element `lst[i]` is even by checking if it's divisible by 2 using the modulus operator `%`. If it is even, we add it to the `total` variable.\n4. After the loop finishes, we return the `total` variable, which contains the sum of even elements at odd indices.\n\nExamples:\n\n```python\nprint(add([4, 2, 6, 7]))  # Output: 2\nprint(add([16, 34, 88, 1]))  # Output: 88\nprint(add([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: 4\nprint(add([3, 5, 7, 9]))  # Output: 0\n```\n\nIn the first example, `add([4, 2, 6, 7])`, the function iterates over the odd indices (1 and 3), finds that the element at index 1 (which is 2) is even, and adds it to the `total`. The element at index 3 (which is 7) is odd, so it's not added. The function returns `total = 2`.\n\nIn the second example, `add([16, 34, 88, 1])`, the function iterates over the odd indices (1 and 3), finds that the elements at both indices (34 and 88) are even, and adds them to the `total`. The function returns `total = 34 + 88 = 122`.\n\nIn the third example, `add([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])`, the function iterates over the odd indices (1 and 3), finds that the element at index 3 (which is 3) is odd, and adds the element at index 1 (which is 1) to the `total`. The function returns `total = 4`.\n\nIn the last example, `add([3, 5, 7, 9])`, the function iterates over the odd indices (1 and 3), but since all the elements at those indices (5 and 9) are odd, it doesn't add anything to the `total`. The function returns `total = 0`."]}

The input string `s` is split into a list of words using the `split()` method: `words = s.split()`. This will create a list of words separated by spaces.\n\n2. An empty list `ordered_words` is created to store the ordered versions of each word.\n\n3. A `for` loop iterates over each word in the `words` list.\n\n4.

We initialize an empty list called `result` to store the coordinates.\n2. We loop through each row in the nested list using `enumerate()` to get both the row index (`row_idx`) and the row itself (`row`).\n3. For each row, we create a list of tuples `[(col_idx, val) for col_idx, val in enumerate(row)]` where `col_idx` is the column index and `val` is the value at that index.\n4.

The `is_prime` function checks if a given number `n` is prime or not by iterating from 2 to the square root of `n` and checking if any number in this range divides `n`. If a divisor is found, the function returns `False`, otherwise it returns `True`.\n\n2. The `sum_of_digits` function calculates the sum of digits of a given number `n`. It does this by repeatedly dividing `n` by 10 and adding the remainder (digit) to a `total` variable until `n` becomes 0.\n\n3. The `skjkasdkd` function first finds the largest prime value in the input list `lst` using the `max` function along with the `filter` function and the `is_prime` function. Then, it passes this largest prime value to the `sum_of_digits` function and returns the result.\n\nThe time complexity of this implementation is O(n * sqrt(m)), where n is the length of the input list `lst`, and m is the largest number in the list. This is because we need to iterate through the entire list to find the largest prime value, and for each number, we need to check if it's prime or not, which takes O(sqrt(m)) time in the worst case."]}

The `is_prime` function takes an integer `n` and checks if it's prime. It first checks if `n` is less than 2 (since 0 and 1 are not considered prime numbers). Then, it iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (since any factor greater than the square root will have a corresponding factor less than the square root). If any number in that range divides `n` evenly, it returns `False` (meaning `n` is not prime). If no such number is found, it returns `True` (meaning `n` is prime).\n\n2. The `count_up_to` function takes a non-negative integer `n` and initializes an empty list `primes`. It then iterates over the range from 2 to `n-1` (since we're interested in prime numbers less than `n`). For each number `num` in that range, it calls the `is_prime` function to check if `num` is prime. If `num` is prime, it appends it to the `primes` list. The loop breaks when the length of `primes` becomes equal to `n` (since we've found the required number of prime numbers). Finally, the function returns the `primes` list.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n```python\nprint(count_up_to(5))  # Output: [2, 3]\nprint(count_up_to(11))  # Output: [2, 3, 5, 7]\nprint(count_up_to(0))  # Output: []\nprint(count_up_to(20))  # Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]\nprint(count_up_to(1))  # Output: []\nprint(count_up_to(18))  # Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]\n```\n\nNote that this implementation has a time complexity of O(n * sqrt(n)), where n is the input value. This is because for each number up to n, we need to check if it's prime, which takes approximately sqrt(n) time in the worst case."]}

The function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.\n2. To get the unit digit of each number, we use the modulus operator `%` with 10.

The unit digits of `a` and `b` are stored in `unit_digit_a` and `unit_digit_b`, respectively.\n4.

The `range(0, len(s), 2)` ensures that we only check characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...).\n4. Inside the loop, we check if the character `s[i]` is a vowel by checking if it is present in the `vowels` string using the `in` operator.\n5.

After the loop finishes, we return the final value of `count`.\n\nHere are some example outputs:\n\n```python\nprint(count_upper('aBCdEf'))  # Output: 1\nprint(count_upper('abcdefg'))  # Output: 0\nprint(count_upper('dBBE'))  # Output: 0\nprint(count_upper('AEIOUaeiou'))  # Output: 5\n```\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input string `s` contains only valid characters (letters).

The function first filters out any numbers not between 1 and 9 inclusive using a list comprehension: `valid_numbers = [num for num in arr if 1 <= num <= 9]`. This creates a new list `valid_numbers` containing only the valid numbers.\n\n2. The `valid_numbers` list is then sorted in ascending order using the `sort()` method: `valid_numbers.sort()`.\n\n3. The sorted `valid_numbers` list is then reversed using slicing with a step of -1: `valid_numbers = valid_numbers[::-1]`.\n\n4. A list of names `names` is created containing the string representations of the numbers from \"One\" to \"Nine\".\n\n5. The function then creates a new list `result` by replacing each number in `valid_numbers` with its corresponding name from the `names` list, using a list comprehension: `result = [names[num - 1] for num in valid_numbers]`.\n\n6.

We initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of elements with a sum of digits greater than 0.\n2. We loop through each element `num` in the input array `arr`.\n3. We convert `num` to a string using `str(abs(num))`. This ensures that we handle negative numbers correctly by taking the absolute value of `num`. For example, `-123` becomes `\"123\"`.\n4. We split the string into individual digits using a list comprehension `[int(digit) for digit in str(abs(num))]`. This creates a list of integers representing the digits of `num`.\n5. We calculate the sum of digits using the `sum()` function: `sum_of_digits = sum(digits)`.\n6. We check if `sum_of_digits` is greater than 0. If it is, we increment the `count` variable.\n7.

If the input array `arr` is empty, the function returns `True` since an empty array is considered sorted.\n2. The function finds the index of the smallest element in the array using `arr.index(min(arr))`.\n3. The function creates a new array `shifted_arr` by shifting the smallest element to the end of the array. This is done by slicing the original array `arr` from the index of the smallest element to the end (`arr[min_idx:]`) and concatenating it with the slice from the beginning to the index of the smallest element (`arr[:min_idx]`).\n4. The function checks if `shifted_arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order by iterating over the array and comparing adjacent elements. If any pair of adjacent elements is found in decreasing order, the function returns `False`.\n5. If the loop completes without finding any pair of adjacent elements in decreasing order, the function returns `True`, indicating that it is possible to obtain a sorted array in non-decreasing order by performing right shift operations.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n```python\nprint(move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2]))  # True\nprint(move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2]))  # False\nprint(move_one_ball([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # True\nprint(move_one_ball([]))  # True\n```\n\nNote that the time complexity of this implementation is O(n), where n is the length of the input array `arr`, since it performs linear operations like finding the minimum element, shifting the array, and checking if the shifted array is sorted."]}

First, we count the number of odd elements in `lst1` by iterating over the list and incrementing a counter `odd_count` for each odd element.\n2. Next, we count the number of even elements in `lst2` by iterating over the list and incrementing a counter `even_count` for each even element.\n3. If the number of odd elements in `lst1` (`odd_count`) is greater than the number of even elements in `lst2` (`even_count`), it is not possible to make all elements of `lst1` even by exchanging elements between the two lists. In this case, we return `\"NO\"`.\n4.

The function takes two arguments: `s` (the original string) and `c` (the string containing characters to be deleted).\n2. Inside the function, we use a list comprehension to create a new string `result` that contains only the characters from `s` that are not present in `c`. We do this by iterating over each character `char` in `s`, and including it in the new string only if `char` is not in the set of characters `set(c)`.\n3.

The `count_ones` function is a helper function that takes a number `num` and returns the count of ones in its binary representation. It uses the `bin` function to convert the number to a binary string, and then counts the number of '1' characters in the string.\n\n2. The `sort_array` function takes an array `arr` as input.\n\n3. Inside `sort_array`, we use the built-in `sorted` function to sort the array. The `key` argument is used to specify a custom sorting key.\n\n4. The `key` function is defined as a lambda function `lambda x: (count_ones(abs(x)), abs(x))`. This function takes an element `x` from the array and returns a tuple `(count_ones(abs(x)), abs(x))`.\n\n5. The `sorted` function first sorts the elements based on the number of ones in their binary representation, using `count_ones(abs(x))`. If two elements have the same number of ones, it then sorts them based on their absolute decimal value `abs(x)`.\n\n6. The sorted array is returned as the result.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n```python\nprint(sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(sort_array([-2, -3, -4, -5, -6]))  # Output: [-6, -5, -4, -3, -2]\nprint(sort_array([1, 0, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n```\n\nThe implementation follows the requirements and passes the provided test cases."]}

The `is_consonant` function checks if a character is a consonant. It first checks if the character is a letter using `char.isalpha()`, and then it checks if the lowercase version of the character is not in the set of vowels `'aeiou'`.\n\n2. The `count_consonants` function counts the number of consonants in a word by iterating over each character and calling `is_consonant` on it.

We define a set `vowels` containing all the vowels (uppercase and lowercase).\n2. We initialize an empty string `closest_vowel` to store the closest vowel that meets the condition.\n3. We iterate over the word from the end to the beginning, skipping the last character (since a vowel at the end doesn't count according to the condition).\n4. For each character, we check if it is a vowel.\n5. If it is a vowel, we check if the characters on its left and right are consonants (i.e., not in the `vowels` set).\n6. If both conditions are met, we store the vowel in `closest_vowel` and break out of the loop (since we only need to find the closest vowel from the right).\n7. Finally, we return the `closest_vowel` string (which will be empty if no vowel met the condition).\n\n**Examples:**\n\n```python\nprint(get_closest_vowel(\"yogurt\"))  # Output: \"u\"\nprint(get_closest_vowel(\"FULL\"))    # Output: \"U\"\nprint(get_closest_vowel(\"quick\"))   # Output: \"\"\nprint(get_closest_vowel(\"ab\"))      # Output: \"\"\n```\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input word.

If `count` becomes greater than 2, we return `False` because there are more than two consecutive duplicates.\n   - If the current element is greater than the previous element, we update `prev` with the current element and reset `count` to 1.\n5. If the loop finishes without returning `False`, we return `True` because the list is sorted.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n```python\nprint(is_sorted([5]))                # True\nprint(is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))    # True\nprint(is_sorted([1, 3, 2, 4, 5]))    # False\nprint(is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])) # True\nprint(is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])) # True\nprint(is_sorted([1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7])) # False\nprint(is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4])) # True\nprint(is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4])) # False\n```\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the input list contains only non-negative integers, as specified in the problem statement."]}

The `is_prime` helper function checks if a given number is prime or not.\n2. The `intersection` function takes two intervals as input.\n3. First, it checks if the intervals don't intersect by checking if the end of one interval is smaller than the start of the other interval, or vice versa. If they don't intersect, it returns \"NO\".\n4. If the intervals intersect, it finds the start and end points of the intersection by taking the maximum of the start points and the minimum of the end points.\n5.

It calls the `is_prime` function to check if the length of the intersection is prime or not.\n7. If the length is prime, it returns \"YES\", otherwise, it returns \"NO\".\n\nYou can test the function with the provided examples:\n\n```python\nprint(intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)))  # Output: \"NO\"\nprint(intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)))  # Output: \"NO\"\nprint(intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)))  # Output: \"YES\"\n```"]}

The function initializes two variables: `product_of_signs` to keep track of the product of signs, and `sum_of_magnitudes` to keep track of the sum of magnitudes.\n3.

We initialize a queue with all possible starting positions and their corresponding paths (initially containing only the starting cell value).\n2. We also maintain a `visited` set to avoid revisiting the same cell with the same path.\n3. In each iteration of the loop, we dequeue a cell and its path from the queue.\n4. If the length of the path is `k`, we return the path as it is the minimum path of length `k`.\n5. Otherwise, we explore all the neighboring cells that are within the grid boundaries.\n6. For each valid neighboring cell, we create a new path by appending the cell's value to the current path.\n7.

The `result` list is initialized with the first three values of the Tribonacci sequence: `[0, 3, 2]`.\n3. A loop iterates from `3` to `n` (inclusive) to calculate the remaining terms of the sequence.\n4. If the current index `i` is even, the term is calculated as `1 + i // 2` (integer division to handle even numbers correctly).\n5. If the current index `i` is odd, the term is calculated as the sum of the previous three terms: `result[i - 1] + result[i - 2] + result[i - 3]`.\n6. The calculated term is appended to the `result` list.\n7. Finally, the `result` list containing the first `n + 1` terms of the Tribonacci sequence is returned.\n\nWith this implementation, the examples given in the docstring will work correctly:\n\n```python\nprint(tri(3))  # Output: [0, 3, 2, 5]\nprint(tri(4))  # Output: [0, 3, 2, 5, 3]\n```\n\nNote that the initial value `0` is included in the output sequence, as per the description in the docstring."]}

The function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, which can be integers, floats, or strings representing real numbers.\n2. It uses a `try`/`except` block to convert the input variables `a` and `b` to floats. If the conversion fails (e.g., for non-numeric strings), it assigns a value of `-inf` (negative infinity) to the corresponding variable.\n3. When converting strings to floats, the `str(a).replace(',', '.')` and `str(b).replace(',', '.')` expressions handle both dot (`.`) and comma (`,`) as decimal separators.\n4. After converting both inputs to floats (`a_float` and `b_float`), the function compares them:\n   - If `a_float` is greater than `b_float`, it returns `a`.\n   - If `b_float` is greater than `a_float`, it returns `b`.\n   - If they are equal, it returns `None`.\n\nHere are some example outputs:\n\n```python\nprint(compare_one(1, 2.5))  # Output: 2.5\nprint(compare_one(1, \"2,3\"))  # Output: \"2,3\"\nprint(compare_one(\"5,1\", \"6\"))  # Output: \"6\"\nprint(compare_one(\"1\", 1))  # Output: None\nprint(compare_one(\"foo\", \"bar\"))  # Output: None\n```\n\nNote that for non-numeric strings like `\"foo\"` and `\"bar\"`, the function assigns `-inf` as their float value, so they are treated as smaller than any numeric value. In this case, the function returns `None` because they are considered equal (both being `-inf`)."]}

The outer loop iterates over the possible values of the first even number `a`, starting from 2 and going up to `n // 4 + 1` (since the sum of 4 even numbers cannot exceed `n`).\n2. For each value of `a`, the inner loop iterates over the possible values of the second even number `b`, starting from `a + 2` (since `b` must be greater than `a`) and going up to `(n - a) // 3 + 1` (since the sum of the remaining two numbers cannot exceed `n - a`).\n3. For each pair of `a` and `b`, the function calculates the third number `c` as `n - a - b`.\n4. If `c` is even and greater than `b`, the function calculates the fourth number `d` as `c - b`. If `d` is positive, it means that we have found a valid set of 4 even numbers that sum up to `n`, so the function returns `True`.\n5.

The numerators of `x` and `n` are multiplied to get the numerator of the result, and the denominators of `x` and `n` are multiplied to get the denominator of the result.\n4. The resulting fraction is simplified by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator using the `gcd` function (implemented using the Euclidean algorithm).\n5. The numerator and denominator of the result are divided by the GCD to simplify the fraction.\n6. Finally, the function checks if the denominator of the simplified fraction is 1.

First, we create a list of tuples `digit_sums` where each tuple contains the sum of digits of the corresponding number, the original index of the number, and the number itself. We use the `sum` function along with a generator expression to calculate the sum of digits for each number. The `abs` function is used to handle negative numbers correctly.\n\n2. Then, we sort the list of tuples `digit_sums` using the `sort` method and a lambda function as the `key`. The lambda function `lambda x: (x[0], x[1])` sorts the tuples first by the sum of digits (`x[0]`) and then by the original index (`x[1]`).

If the condition is satisfied, we extract the first and last digits of `num` using the following steps:\n   - `first_digit = abs(num) // 10 ** (len(str(abs(num))) - 1)`: This expression calculates the first digit of the number by dividing the absolute value of `num` by 10 raised to the power of the number of digits in `num` minus 1. For example, if `num` is 1234, then `len(str(abs(num))) - 1` is 3, so we divide `num` by 10^3 = 1000, which gives us the first digit 1.\n   - `last_digit = abs(num) % 10`: This expression calculates the last digit of the number by taking the remainder of the absolute value of `num` divided by 10.\n5.

We check if both `planet1` and `planet2` are valid planet names by checking if they exist in the `planets` list. If either of them is not a valid planet name, we return an empty tuple `()`.\n3. We find the indices of `planet1` and `planet2` in the `planets` list using the `index()` method.\n4. We determine which planet is closer to the Sun by comparing their indices. If `planet1` is closer, we set `start` to `p1_index + 1` (to exclude `planet1`) and `end` to `p2_index`. Otherwise, we set `start` to `p2_index` and `end` to `p1_index`.\n5.

The `sorted` function is called with the `even_length_strings` list, and a custom `key` function is provided. The `key` function returns a tuple `(len(x), x)` for each string `x` in the list.

The `is_prime` function is a helper function that checks if a given number `n` is prime or not. It first checks if `n` is less than 2, in which case it returns `False` since 1 is not considered a prime number. Then, it iterates through the range from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive) and checks if `n` is divisible by any number in that range. If it finds a divisor, it returns `False`. If no divisor is found, it returns `True`.\n\n2. The `x_or_y` function takes three arguments: `n`, `x`, and `y`. It first calls the `is_prime` function with `n` as an argument to check if `n` is a prime number or not.\n\n3. If `is_prime(n)` returns `True`, the function returns `x`. Otherwise, it returns `y`.\n\n4. In the examples, the function is called with different values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the results are printed to the console.\n\nFor example, when `x_or_y(7, 34, 12)` is called, `n` is 7 (which is a prime number), `x` is 34, and `y` is 12. Since 7 is a prime number, the function returns the value of `x`, which is 34.\n\nOn the other hand, when `x_or_y(15, 8, 5)` is called, `n` is 15 (which is not a prime number), `x` is 8, and `y` is 5. Since 15 is not a prime number, the function returns the value of `y`, which is 5."]}

After iterating over all the numbers, the function returns the final `total`.\n\nIf the input list is empty, the function will return 0 since the `total` will remain at its initial value of 0.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n```python\nprint(double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]))  # Output: 10\nprint(double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]))  # Output: 0\nprint(double_the_difference([9, -2]))  # Output: 81\nprint(double_the_difference([0]))  # Output: 0\nprint(double_the_difference([]))  # Output: 0\n```"]}

First, we check if the length of the second word (`n`) is greater than the length of the first word (`m`). If it is, we return `False` because a longer word cannot be a substring of a shorter word.\n\n2. Next, we generate all possible rotations of the second word using a list comprehension. For example, if `b` is \"abc\", the rotations would be `['abc', 'bca', 'cab']`. We do this by slicing the string `b` from index `i` to the end and concatenating it with the part from the start to index `i`.\n\n3. We then iterate over each rotation and check if it is a substring of the first word (`a`) using the `in` operator. If any rotation is found as a substring, we return `True`.\n\n4. If we exhaust all rotations and none of them is a substring of `a`, we return `False`.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n```python\nprint(cycpattern_check(\"abcd\", \"abd\"))  # False\nprint(cycpattern_check(\"hello\", \"ell\"))  # True\nprint(cycpattern_check(\"whassup\", \"psus\"))  # False\nprint(cycpattern_check(\"abab\", \"baa\"))  # True\nprint(cycpattern_check(\"efef\", \"eeff\"))  # False\nprint(cycpattern_check(\"himenss\", \"simen\"))  # True\n```\n\nNote that this solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the second word, since we generate all rotations and check each one for being a substring of the first word.

This value is stored in the `to_eat` variable.\n\n2. We then check if there are enough remaining carrots (`remaining`) for you to eat the required number (`to_eat`). If there are enough remaining carrots, we calculate the total number of carrots you'll have eaten (`total_eaten`) by adding `number` and `to_eat`. We also calculate the number of carrots left (`carrots_left`) by subtracting `to_eat` from `remaining`.\n\n3. If there are not enough remaining carrots, you'll eat all the remaining carrots. So, we set `total_eaten` to `number` + `remaining`, and `carrots_left` to 0.\n\n4. Finally, we return a list containing the total number of carrots eaten (`total_eaten`) and the number of carrots left (`carrots_left`).\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n```python\nprint(eat(5, 6, 10))  # Output: [11, 4]\nprint(eat(4, 8, 9))   # Output: [12, 1]\nprint(eat(1, 10, 10)) # Output: [11, 0]\nprint(eat(2, 11, 5))  # Output: [7, 0]\n```\n\nThe function handles the constraints mentioned in the problem statement, ensuring that the input values are within the specified ranges."]}

The function takes two lists as input: `operator` and `operand`.\n2. It initializes the `result` variable with the first element of the `operand` list.\n3. It iterates over the `operator` list using a `for` loop.\n4. For each operator `op` and corresponding operand `num`, it performs the operation on `result` and `num` based on the operator.\n5. After all operations are performed, it returns the final `result`.\n\nHere are some example usages:\n\n```python\nprint(do_algebra(['+', '*', '-'], [2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: 9\nprint(do_algebra(['-', '//'], [10, 3, 2]))  # Output: 1\nprint(do_algebra(['**'], [3, 4]))  # Output: 81\nprint(do_algebra(['+', '*', '-', '//'], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]))  # Output: 0\n```\n\nNote: The function assumes that the input lists are valid according to the given constraints.

{"task_id": "HumanEval/161", "solution": ["Here's an implementation of the `solve` function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef solve(s):\n    has_letters = any(char.isalpha() for char in s)\n    \n    if has_letters:\n        return ''.join(char.lower() if char.isupper() else char.upper() for char in s)\n    else:\n        return s[::-1]\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. First, we check if the input string `s` contains any letters using the `any` function and a generator expression:\n\n```python\nhas_letters = any(char.isalpha() for char in s)\n```\n\nThe `char.isalpha()` method checks if a character is a letter (uppercase or lowercase). The `any` function returns `True` if any element in the iterable (in this case, the generator expression) evaluates to `True`. If the string contains at least one letter, `has_letters` will be `True`.\n\n2. If `has_letters` is `True`, we use a generator expression to reverse the case of each character in the string:\n\n```python\nreturn ''.join(char.lower() if char.isupper() else char.upper() for char in s)\n```\n\nThe generator expression `char.lower() if char.isupper() else char.upper()` checks if each character `char` is uppercase (`char.isupper()`). If it is, it converts it to lowercase using `char.lower()`. Otherwise, it converts it to uppercase using `char.upper()`. The resulting list of characters is then joined using the `join` method with an empty string `''` as the separator, effectively concatenating all the characters into a new string.\n\n3. If `has_letters` is `False`, it means the string contains no letters, so we return the reversed string using slicing:\n\n```python\nreturn s[::-1]\n```\n\nThe slice notation `s[::-1]` creates a new string with the characters in reverse order.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n```python\nprint(solve(\"1234\"))  # Output: \"4321\"\nprint(solve(\"ab\"))    # Output: \"AB\"\nprint(solve(\"#a@C\"))  # Output: \"#A@c\"\nprint(solve(\"1@2#\"))  # Output: \"#2@1\"\n```\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, since we need to iterate over each character in the string once."]}
{"task_id": "HumanEval/162", "solution": ["To implement the `string_to_md5` function in Python, we can use the built-in `hashlib` module, which provides a simple interface to various secure hash and message digest algorithms, including MD5. Here's the implementation:\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\n\ndef string_to_md5(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a string 'text', return its md5 hash equivalent string.\n    If 'text' is an empty string, return None.\n\n    >>> string_to_md5('Hello world') == '3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62'\n    True\n    \"\"\"\n    if not text:\n        return None\n\n    # Create an MD5 hash object\n    md5_hash = hashlib.md5()\n\n    # Convert the string to bytes and update the hash object\n    md5_hash.update(text.encode('utf-8'))\n\n    # Get the hexadecimal digest of the hash\n    md5_digest = md5_hash.hexdigest()\n\n    return md5_digest\n```\n\nHere's how the `string_to_md5` function works:\n\n1. First, we import the `hashlib` module, which provides the MD5 hashing functionality.\n\n2. The function takes a string `text` as input.\n\n3. If `text` is an empty string (`not text` evaluates to `True`), the function returns `None`.\n\n4. Otherwise, we create an MD5 hash object using `hashlib.md5()`.\n\n5. We convert the input string `text` to bytes using the `encode('utf-8')` method, as the `hashlib` module expects data in bytes format.\n\n6. We update the hash object with the bytes representation of the input string using `md5_hash.update(text.encode('utf-8'))`.\n\n7. After updating the hash object with the input data, we get the hexadecimal digest of the hash using `md5_hash.hexdigest()`. This digest is a string representation of the MD5 hash.\n\n8. Finally, the function returns the MD5 hash digest as a string.\n\nThe docstring includes an example test case, which demonstrates how the function should work. When you run the code, it will also execute the test case and print `True` if the test passes.\n\nNote that MD5 is not considered secure for cryptographic purposes anymore, as it is vulnerable to collision attacks. However, it is still widely used for data integrity checks and non-cryptographic applications."]}

First, we convert `a` and `b` to positive integers using the `abs()` function and `int()` type conversion.\n2. If `a` is greater than `b`, we swap the values of `a` and `b` using tuple unpacking.\n3. We initialize an empty list `result` to store the even digits.\n4. We iterate through the range `range(a, b+1)` using a `for` loop.\n5. Inside the loop, we check if the current number `num` is even by checking if `num % 2 == 0`.\n6. If the number is even, we append it to the `result` list.\n7. After the loop completes, we return the `result` list.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n```python\nprint(generate_integers(2, 8))  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]\nprint(generate_integers(8, 2))  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]\nprint(generate_integers(10, 14))  # Output: []\nprint(generate_integers(-5, 5))  # Output: [-4, -2, 0, 2, 4]\n```\n\nNote that the function handles negative numbers and ensures that the ordering of `a` and `b` does not affect the output. If there are no even digits between `a` and `b`, the function returns an empty list."]}
